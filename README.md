## Version 2

##### [gfx.v2](https://azul3d.org/gfx.v2) package:

* Added `Mesh.Append` method to append two meshes together (see [#21](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/21)).
* Added `MeshState` type to check if two meshes can append together perfectly (see [#21](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/21)).
* `TexCoord` and `Color` are now valid types for use in the `Shader.Input` map and as data to `VertexAttrib` (see [#23](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/23)).
* Added a convenience `Mesh.Normals` slice for storing the normals of a mesh (see [#11](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/11)).

##### [gfx.v2/window](https://azul3d.org/gfx.v2/window) package:

* Moved to this repository as a sub-package (see [old repository](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx-window) and [issue 33](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/33)).
* Better documentation (see [#49](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/pull/49)).
* Added support for multiple windows (see [#38](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/38)).
* Exposed the main thread for clients that need it (see [#39](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/39)).

##### [gfx.v2/gl2](https://azul3d.org/gfx.v2/gl2) package:

* Moved to this repository as a sub-package (see [old repository](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx-gl2) and [issue 33](https://github.com/azul3d/issues/issues/33)).
* Renderer now uses just one OpenGL context (see [#24](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/24)).
* Improved package documentation ([view commit](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx-gl2/commit/493f72dbb36547e394f2d4995ee7d74dbf7b86d4)).
