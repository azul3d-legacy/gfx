	// The window will not block sending events to ch: the caller must ensure
	// that ch has a sufficient amount of buffer space to keep up with the
	// event rate.

	// If you only expect to receive a single event like Close then a buffer
	// size of one is acceptable.

	// above 1000hz, so for cursor events a generous buffer size (256, etc) is
